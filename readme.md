## Compiling

Any C++ compiler should work.

To build the GUI, you need Qt.

When building the command line tool, [PCRE](http://www.pcre.org/) is normally used.
PCRE is optional.

There are multiple compilation choices:
* qmake - cross platform build tool
* Windows: Visual Studio or Qt Creator or MinGW
* gnu make
* g++

### Visual Studio 2010

Use the cpp2go.sln file.
